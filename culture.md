# Culture and Government

## Occasions

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Bank holiday | **Holiday** | They're differently spaced throughout the year, too.
Fortnight | Two weeks | Be warned that "biweekly" can mean fortnightly *or* twice a week.
**Holiday** | Vacation | Often way less of it in the US.


## Medical

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
A&E | ER  |
Doctor's surgery | Doctor's office |
Flu jab | Flu shot | Given to a lot more people in the US.
Paracetamol | Acetaminophen | Yes, these are exactly the same thing.
Plaster | Band-aid |
Benadryl | Zyrtec or Semprex | The medicine branded as Benadryl in the UK is either cetrizine or acrivastine
? | Benadryl | US Benadryl is diphenhydramine, which is not commonly (?) sold as an antihistamine in the UK

Notes:
* Intensive care in the US is about 10x larger than in the UK, and so a bit less specialised.


## Education

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Creche/Nursery school | Pre-school/Pre-K (up to 4 years old), Kindergarten (4-5 years old) | 
Primary school | Elementary school |
Secondary school | Middle school (grades 7 & 8), High school (grades 9 - 12) |
Year | Grade | Grade is UK school year minus one, e.g. Grade 9 = Year 10.
Public school | Private school | UK public schools are elite and fee-paying, but typically have charity status and award funding to some students
(University) Freshman/Freshwoman/Freshperson * | First year | sometimes "Fresher"
(University) Sophomore | Second year |
(University) Junior | Third year |
(University) Senior | Fourth year | UK undergraduate degrees typically only last three years
College | ?? | Hang on tight. In the UK, a college can either be a school where students aged 16--19 study for advanced secondary qualifications in preparation for university (a Sixth Form College), or a post-secondary non-univeristy institution which offers professional and vocational training (a Further Education College), or a constituent semi-autonomous body within a larger university with educational, pastoral, and residential responsibilities but without degree-granting authority (e.g. Nuffield College, Oxford or SOAS University of London), or an independent university in its own right, but which has less than 1000 students (a university college)**. Some institutions which are none of these things have "College" in their name: Eton College is a public (i.e. private) school, Imperial College London is a university.
Prep school | ? | Tuition-based school for ages 8--13
University | College | Technically, the usage is the same as in the UK university context, e.g. the College of Dental Medicine is part of Columbia University. But commonly univerisities themselves are referred to as "colleges". Some US universities have residential colleges (e.g. Wilson College at Princeton), but typically these have no educational role, unlike many of the UK colleges which are part of universities.
? | School | The same synechdoche happens as with "college": US universities are made up of colleges and schools, but often the entire university is referred to as a school. So someone "going to school" could easily be in their late thirties and studying for an advanced degree.

Notes:
* Students in their last four years of secondary education in the US are also called Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior
** However, Univeristy College, Oxford is not a university college but a constitutent college of Oxford University. University College Birmingham is a university, not a university college. University College London is a college of the University of London, but not a university college, although it has its own independent degree-granting authority.

## Politics

UK  | US  | Notes
--- | --- | ---
**MP** | Congressperson | In the US, **MP** means Military Police, so it can get very confusing.
